This is a simple initial value problem for a stratified shear flow in which the shear and stritification
profiles have unequal and vertically offset characteristic thicknesses. It is motivated by the work of 
Greg Lawrence, Neil Balmforth and their students at UBC. 

The "test setup" is configured for a 2d flow in the yz plane and uses 2 processors. An extra passive
scalar is carried along as are 1000 Lagrangian particles.

The flow is periodic in y with free-slip rigid lids in z.

The initial conditions are unstable and an initial perturbation grows to finite amplitude. The
instability is vertically asymmetric and has a finite horizontal phase speed.

This configuration runs to completion on my dual core MacBook Pro in about 25 minutes though the solution is
"interesting" after about 5 or so if you don't want to run it that long.
