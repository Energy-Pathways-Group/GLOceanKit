function [energyFrequency,omegaVector] = convertFromWavenumberToFrequency(self)
%  Summary
%  This method transforms an instantaneous WVT field that is in the 
%  horizontal wave number domain to the frequency domain.
%
%  At this point the method is only set to return the total wave energy.
%  In the future I plan to include an option for the user
%  to transform any WVT field (Leticia)

% - Topic: Operations — Transformations
% - Declaration: [varargout] = wvt.convertFromWavenumberToFrequency
% - Parameter varargin: WVT
% - Returns varargout: energyFrequency has dimensions $$(j,omegaVector)$$
