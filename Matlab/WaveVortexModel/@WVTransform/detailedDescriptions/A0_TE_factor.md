These coefficients multiply $$A_0^2$$ to give a horizontally-averaged depth-integrated total energy for the geostrophic solutions.

Assuming hydrostatic modes, this is

$$
E = \frac{g}{2} \left( \frac{gh}{f_0^2} K^2 + 1 \right)
$$ 

for the $$j>0$$ modes and

$$
E = \frac{g^2 L_z}{2f_0^2} K^2
$$ 

for the $$j=0$$ barotropic mode.
