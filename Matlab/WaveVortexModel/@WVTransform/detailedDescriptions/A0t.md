- Topic: Wave-vortex coefficients â€” at time $$t$$

These are the *time dependent* coefficients of the geostrophic flow, denoted  $$A_0$$ in [Early, et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.995).

These geostrophic coefficients do not have any linear time dependence on the $$f$$-plane and thus are identical to `A0`.
