- Topic: Domain Attributes â€” Stratification

The equivalent depth (or eigendepth) of each vertical mode in constant stratification is written in the line preceding equation A2 in [Early, et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.995),

$$
h_j = \frac{1}{g} \frac{N_0^2 - f_0^2}{m_j^2 + k^2 + l^2}
$$

where $$m_j = \frac{j \pi}{L_z}$$.

If `isHydrostatic==0`, then the equivalent depths do not depend on horizontal wavenumber,

$$
h = \frac{1}{g} \frac{N_0^2}{m_j^2}
$$
