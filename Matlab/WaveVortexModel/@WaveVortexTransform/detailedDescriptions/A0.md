- Topic: Wave-vortex coefficients

These are the coefficients of the geostrophic portion of the flow. The details of how these coefficients are defined are in [Early, et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.995). The geostrophic solution is shown in equation (3.5). A summary of the hydrostatic transformations is in equations (C1)-(C5).

Note that the $$k=l=0$$ geostrophic solution is not taken to be zero, unlike section 3.1 in the manuscript. If your mean density $$\bar{\rho}(z)$$ really is the spatial mean in the domain, then the $$k=l=0$$ solutions must be zero, as stated in the manuscript. However, in a practical sense it is useful to allow the domain density mean to differ from the defined mean, so we therefore allow a 'mean density anomaly' to exist.
