 - Topic: Energetics â€” Multiplicative factors

These coefficients multiply $$A_0$$ to give a horizontally-averaged depth-integrated total energy for the geostrophic solutions.

Assuming hydrostatic modes, this is

$$
E = \frac{g}{2} \left( \frac{gh}{f_0^2} K^2 + 1 \right)
$$ 

and

$$
E = \frac{g}{2} \left( \frac{g L_z}{f_0^2} K^2 + 1 \right)
$$ 

for the barotropic mode.
