- Topic: Wave-vortex coefficients â€” at time $$t$$

These are the *time dependent* coefficients of the internal gravity wave and inertial oscillation portion of the flow, denoted  $$A_- e^{-i \omega t} $$ in [Early, et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.995).

Unlike `Am`, these coefficients do not have their phases wound to time $$t_0$$ (`t0`), and **do** change for linear dynamics.
