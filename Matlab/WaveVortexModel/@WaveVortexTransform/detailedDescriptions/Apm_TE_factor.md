 - Topic: Energetics â€” Multiplicative factors

These coefficients multiply $$A_+$$ and $$A_-$$ to give a horizontally-averaged depth-integrated total energy for those wave solutions.

For the internal waves this is simply,

$$
E = A_\pm^2 h
$$ 

and

$$
E = A_\pm^2 L_z
$$ 

for the barotropic mode at $$j=0$$.
