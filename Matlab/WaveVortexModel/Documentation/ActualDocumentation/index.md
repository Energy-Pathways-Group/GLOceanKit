WaveVortexModel
==============

The WaveVortexModel decomposes a Boussinesq fluid with arbitrary stratification into geostrophic motions and interia-gravity waves. This model is complete, and therefore also can be time-stepped forward

The model is based on the [decomposition described in Early, Lelong and Sundermeyer, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.995);
