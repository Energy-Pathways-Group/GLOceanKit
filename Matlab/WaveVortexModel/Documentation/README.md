Documentation
==============

The documentation for the WaveVortexModel is primarily derived from the standard help markup used by Matlab. Classes, methods and properties all have short descriptions and detailed descriptions written inline with the code. For the most part, we simply extract that information and dump it into a markdown file. However, there are two important exceptions 1) we extract some additional (optional) markup such as topics, declarations and parameters and 2) we treat the WVTransform differently.

Enabling Mathjax can be done following the examples [here](https://github.com/pdmosses/test-nav);
