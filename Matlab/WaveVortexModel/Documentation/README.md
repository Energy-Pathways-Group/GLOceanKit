Documentation
==============

+ The WebsiteDocumentation folder contains markdown files with documentation that is intended to be copied directly to the /docs folder in this repository and hosted with GitHub Pages.
+ The WebsiteBuilder folder contains a series of scripts to extract documentation from the classes, parse metadata, and then build markdown files which also get hosted with GitHub Pages.
