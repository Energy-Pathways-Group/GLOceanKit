classdef WVNonlinearFluxOperation < WVOperation
% Computes the nonlinear flux for a WVTransform
% 
% A WVNonlinearFluxOperation defines how energy moves between the
% wave-vortex coefficients---these are the nonlinear terms in the equations
% of motion, transformed into wave-vortex space. The most basic
% implementation is a freely evolving, unforced (and undamped) flux.
% Subclasses of WVNonlinearFluxOperation can implement custom forcing and
% damping.
% 
% A WVTransform is always initialized with a default nonlinear flux
% operation, but it can be overridden with,
% 
% ```matlab
% wvt.nonlinearFluxOperation = SomeNewNonlinearFluxOperation();
% ```
% 
% It is very likely you will want to use a custom nonlinear flux operation
% when integrating a model. In that case you would call,
% 
% ```matlab
% model = WVModel(wvt,nonlinearFlux=SomeNewNonlinearFluxOperation())
% ```
% 
% When creating a subclass of WVNonlinearFluxOperation, there are several
% important notes:
% 
% + The output variables *must* be at least one of {Fp,Fm,F0}, in that
% order. The properties `doesFluxAp` etc. should be appropriately set to
% match the output.
% + You may also optionally output additional variables
% that are computed as a by product of your flux calculation. Those
% variables will then be cached, and will not have to be recomputed when
% needed.
