## Overview

NetCDF files are a standard file format for reading and writing data. This class is designed to simply the task of adding new dimensions, variables, and attributes to a NetCDF file.

### Initialization

`self = NetCDFFile(path,overwriteExisting)`

Calling,
```matlab
ncfile = NetCDFFile(path)
```
will load an existing file (if one exists) or create a new file (if none exists).
```matlab
ncfile = NetCDFFile(path,'OVERWRITE_EXISTING')
```
will delete any existing file and create a new file.

### Adding attributes, dimensions and variables

### `addAttribute(name,data)`

### [dimension,variable] = addDimension(name,data,properties,dimLength)
