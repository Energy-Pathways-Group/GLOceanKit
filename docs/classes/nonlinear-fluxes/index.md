#  Nonlinear flux operations

Nonlinear flux operations are used for taking a nonlinear time step with the model. See the [users guide](http://wavevortexmodel.org/users-guide/nonlinear-flux-operations.html) for an overview of classes and their usage.

All nonlinear flux operations are a subclass of [WVNonlinearFluxOperation](/classes-nonlinearfluxes/wvnonlinearfluxoperation/).
