## Discussion

  The detailed description may be written in markdown and may also
  use MathJax latex notation. The detailed description will be used
  for the help documentation.
 
  The detailed description can be populated using a markdown
  sidecar file. Specifically, when the WVAnnotation (or subclass)
  is initialized, it will look in the directory and one directory
  deep for a markdown file with the name of the annotation and the
  file extension .md.
