#  Transforms

The WVTransform subclasses encapsulate data representing the *state* of the ocean at a given instant in time (e.g., u, v, w, and rho). What makes the WaveVortexTransform subclasses special is that the state of the ocean is represented as energetically independent waves and geostrophic motions (vortices). These classes can be queried for other information, e.g., Ertel PV, relative vorticity, etc.
