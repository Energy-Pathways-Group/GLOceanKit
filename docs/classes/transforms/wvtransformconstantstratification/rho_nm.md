#  rho_nm

$$\rho_\textrm{nm}(z)$$, no-motion density


---

## Description
Real valued property with dimension $$z$$ and units of $$kg m^{-3}$$.

## Discussion

The no-motion density $$\rho_\textrm{nm}$$ is strictly a function of $$z$$ and represents the configuration of the minimum potential energy state. Note that mean density, typically denoted $$\bar{\rho}$$ differs from $$\rho_\textrm{nm}$$ when there is a mean-density anomaly.
