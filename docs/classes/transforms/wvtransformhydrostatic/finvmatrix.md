#  FinvMatrix

transformation matrix $$F_g^{-1}$$


---

## Description
Real valued property with dimensions $$(z,j)$$ and no units.

## Discussion

This is the geostrophic transformation matrix $$F_g^{-1}$$ that transforms a vector from vertical mode space to physical space. Thus the columns are the vertical modes. Typically applied to variables $$u$$, $$v$$, $$p$$.
