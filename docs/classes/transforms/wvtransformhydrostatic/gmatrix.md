transformation matrix $$G_g$$


---

## Description
Real valued property with dimensions $$(j,z)$$ and no units.

## Discussion

This is the geostrophic transformation matrix $$G_g$$ that transforms a vector from physical space to vertical mode space. Typically applied to variables $$\eta$$ and possibly $$w$$.
