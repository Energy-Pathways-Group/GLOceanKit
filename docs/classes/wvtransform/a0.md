#  A0

geostrophic coefficients at reference time t0


---

## Description
Complex valued state variable with dimensions $$(k,l,j)$$ and units of $$m$$.

## Discussion

These are the coefficients of the geostrophic portion of the flow, denoted  $$A_0$$ in [Early, et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.995). The geostrophic solution is shown in equation (3.5). A summary of the hydrostatic transformations is in equations (C1)-(C5).

The three different solutions for the geostrophic mode are: barotropic geostrophic ($$G^0$$), geostrophic ($$G$$), and mean density anomaly ($$\bar{\rho}^\prime$$). They exist in the $$A_0$$ array as follows (where k and l are considered equivalent),

|  j\k  | **0** | **1** | **2** | **3** |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **0** |                     |$$G^0$$|$$G^0$$|$$G^0$$|
| **1** |$$\bar{\rho}^\prime$$| $$G$$ | $$G$$ | $$G$$ |
| **2** |$$\bar{\rho}^\prime$$| $$G$$ | $$G$$ | $$G$$ |
| **3** |$$\bar{\rho}^\prime$$| $$G$$ | $$G$$ | $$G$$ |

Note that the $$k=l=0$$ geostrophic solution is not taken to be zero, unlike section 3.1 in the manuscript. If your mean density $$\bar{\rho}(z)$$ really is the spatial mean in the domain, then the $$k=l=0$$ solutions must be zero, as stated in the manuscript. However, in a practical sense it is useful to allow the domain density mean to differ from the defined mean, so we therefore allow a 'mean density anomaly' to exist.
