#  A0t

geostrophic coefficients at time t


---

## Description
Complex valued state variable with dimensions $$(k,l,j)$$ and units of $$m$$.

## Discussion

These are the *time dependent* coefficients of the geostrophic flow, denoted  $$A_0$$ in [Early, et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2020.995).

These geostrophic coefficients do not have any linear time dependence on the $$f$$-plane and thus are identical to `A0`.
