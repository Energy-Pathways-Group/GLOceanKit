#  t

time of observations


---

## Description
Real valued state variable with no dimensions and units of $$s$$.

## Discussion

The time `t` is the time of observation. A `WVTransform` instance represents the state of the ocean at time `t`. 

Time is considered a dimension, but as far as any `WVTransform` instance is concerned, it is always only one point.
