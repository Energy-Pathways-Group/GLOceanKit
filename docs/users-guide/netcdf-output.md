#  WaveVortexModel NetCDF output

WaveVortexModel NetCDF output follows the [CF metadata conventions](https://cfconventions.org) to "promote the processing and sharing of files created with the NetCDF API". These conventions are (mostly) automatically followed by the code.

For data that is intended to be distributed, it is also useful to follow the [attribute convention for data discovery](https://wiki.esipfed.org/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3). These additional attributes are not added automatically by the WaveVortexModel, but a tool is provided for making this easy.

## Global attributes

## Variables

- `name' name of the variable used by the WVOperation
- `standard_name' the standard name must come
